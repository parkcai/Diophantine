(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 701)   7 ^ x + 10 = 101 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 10 = 101 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 91 (mod 101).
So x = 75 (mod 100), 
which implies x = 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 (mod 175).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 1, 369, 167, 636, 550, 361, 19 (mod 701).
So 101 ^ y = 11, 379, 177, 646, 560, 371, 29 (mod 701), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 10 = 101 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   7 ^ x + 10 = 499 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 10 = 499 ^ y,
if x >= 1, 499 ^ y = 3 (mod 7).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 10 = 499 ^ y is impossible.

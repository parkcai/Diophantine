(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 61)   7 ^ x + 1 = 13 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 1 = 13 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 12 (mod 13).
So x = 6 (mod 12), 
which implies x = 6, 18, 30, 42, 54 (mod 60).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 41, 52, 60, 27, 3 (mod 61).
So 13 ^ y = 42, 53, 0, 28, 4 (mod 61), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 1 = 13 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 421)   7 ^ x + 1 = 211 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 1 = 211 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 210 (mod 211).
So x = 105 (mod 210), 
which implies x = 35 (mod 70).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 420 (mod 421).
So 211 ^ y = 0 (mod 421), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 1 = 211 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 1 = 242 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 10 (mod 11).
So x = 5 (mod 10), 
which implies x = 0, 5, 10 (mod 15).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 1, 5, 25 (mod 31).
So 242 ^ y = 2, 6, 26 (mod 31), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 1 = 242 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 61)   7 ^ x + 1 = 13 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 1 = 13 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 12 (mod 13).
So x = 6 (mod 12), 
which implies x = 6, 18, 30, 42, 54 (mod 60).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 41, 52, 60, 27, 3 (mod 61).
So 13 ^ y = 42, 53, 0, 28, 4 (mod 61), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 1 = 13 ^ y is impossible.

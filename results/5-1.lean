For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 5 ^ x = 3 (mod 4).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 1 = 3 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 101)   5 ^ x + 1 = 13 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 1 = 13 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 13 ^ y = 1 (mod 25).
So y = 0 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40 (mod 50).
Therefore, 13 ^ y = 1, 87, 95, 84, 36 (mod 101).
So 5 ^ x = 0, 86, 94, 83, 35 (mod 101), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 1 = 13 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 67)   5 ^ x + 1 = 23 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 1 = 23 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 5 ^ x = 22 (mod 23).
So x = 11 (mod 22).
Therefore, 5 ^ x = 66 (mod 67).
So 23 ^ y = 0 (mod 67), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 5 ^ x + 1 = 23 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 1 = 87 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 101)   5 ^ x + 1 = 97 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 1 = 97 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 97 ^ y = 1 (mod 25).
So y = 0 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 (mod 25).
Therefore, 97 ^ y = 1, 87, 95, 84, 36 (mod 101).
So 5 ^ x = 0, 86, 94, 83, 35 (mod 101), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 1 = 97 ^ y is impossible.

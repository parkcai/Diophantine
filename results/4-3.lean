For positive integers x, y satisfying 4 ^ x + 3 = 5 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 241)   4 ^ x + 3 = 83 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 4 ^ x + 3 = 83 ^ y,
if x >= 6, 83 ^ y = 3 (mod 64).
So y = 5 (mod 16), 
which implies y = 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, 53, 57 (mod 60).
Therefore, 83 ^ y = 83, 237, 6, 232, 134, 40, 181, 90, 106, 82, 118, 64, 145, 144, 25 (mod 241).
So 4 ^ x = 80, 234, 3, 229, 131, 37, 178, 87, 103, 79, 115, 61, 142, 141, 22 (mod 241), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 6.
Further examination shows that 4 ^ x + 3 = 83 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 17)   4 ^ x + 3 = 227 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 4 ^ x + 3 = 227 ^ y,
if x >= 6, 227 ^ y = 3 (mod 64).
So y = 9 (mod 16), 
Therefore, 227 ^ y = 11 (mod 17).
So 4 ^ x = 8 (mod 17), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 6.
Further examination shows that 4 ^ x + 3 = 227 ^ y is impossible.

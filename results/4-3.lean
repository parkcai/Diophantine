(Class I, Type iii)   4 ^ x + 3 = 2 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 4 ^ x + 3 = 2 ^ y,
if x >= 2 and y >= 2,
3 = 0 (mod 4), which is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2 or y < 2.
Further examination shows that 4 ^ x + 3 = 2 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 4 ^ x + 3 = 83 ^ y,

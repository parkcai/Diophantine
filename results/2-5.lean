For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 5 = 2 ^ y,

Therefore, x < 3 or y < 3.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 281)   2 ^ x + 5 = 29 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 5 = 29 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 2 ^ x = 24 (mod 29).
So x = 8 (mod 28), 
which implies x = 8, 22, 36, 50, 64 (mod 70).
Therefore, 2 ^ x = 256, 98, 279, 109, 101 (mod 281).
So 29 ^ y = 261, 103, 3, 114, 106 (mod 281), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 2 ^ x + 5 = 29 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 43)   2 ^ x + 5 = 133 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 5 = 133 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 2 ^ x = 44 (mod 49).
So x = 10 (mod 21), 
which implies x = 3, 10 (mod 14).
Therefore, 2 ^ x = 8, 35 (mod 43).
So 133 ^ y = 13, 40 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (7, 1).

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 17)   2 ^ x + 5 = 197 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 5 = 197 ^ y,
if x >= 6, 197 ^ y = 5 (mod 64).
So y = 1 (mod 16), 
Therefore, 197 ^ y = 10 (mod 17).
So 2 ^ x = 5 (mod 17), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 6.
Further examination shows that 2 ^ x + 5 = 197 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 109)   2 ^ x + 5 = 261 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 5 = 261 ^ y,
if y >= 3, 2 ^ x = 22 (mod 27).
So x = 14 (mod 18), 
which implies x = 14, 32 (mod 36).
Therefore, 2 ^ x = 34, 75 (mod 109).
So 261 ^ y = 39, 80 (mod 109), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 3.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (8, 1).

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 241)   2 ^ x + 5 = 277 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 5 = 277 ^ y,
if x >= 6, 277 ^ y = 5 (mod 64).
So y = 5 (mod 16), 
which implies y = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 (mod 10).
Therefore, 277 ^ y = 36, 143, 240, 150, 154 (mod 241).
So 2 ^ x = 31, 138, 235, 145, 149 (mod 241), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 6.
Further examination shows that 2 ^ x + 5 = 277 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 31)   2 ^ x + 5 = 429 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 5 = 429 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 2 ^ x = 6 (mod 11).
So x = 9 (mod 10), 
which implies x = 4 (mod 5).
Therefore, 2 ^ x = 16 (mod 31).
So 429 ^ y = 21 (mod 31), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 2 ^ x + 5 = 429 ^ y is impossible.

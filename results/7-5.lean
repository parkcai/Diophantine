(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   7 ^ x + 5 = 2 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 5 = 2 ^ y,
if x >= 1, 2 ^ y = 5 (mod 7).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 5 = 2 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 5 = 3 ^ y,

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 5 = 271 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 271 ^ y = 5 (mod 49).
So y = 19 (mod 42),

Therefore, 271 ^ y = 14 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 9 (mod 43), but this is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 5 = 297 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 6 (mod 11).
So x = 7 (mod 10), 
which implies x = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 (mod 12).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 7, 162, 155, 174, 19, 26 (mod 181).
So 297 ^ y = 12, 167, 160, 179, 24, 31 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 5 = 297 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 5 = 499 ^ y,
if x >= 1, 499 ^ y = 5 (mod 7).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 5 = 499 ^ y is impossible.

(Class I, Type i)   7 ^ x + 5 = 500 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 5 = 500 ^ y,
this is impossible, because it implies that 7 ^ x = 0 (mod 5).

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 8 = 5 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 271)   3 ^ x + 8 = 17 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 8 = 17 ^ y,
if x >= 5, 17 ^ y = 8 (mod 243).
So y = 5 (mod 54), 
which implies y = 5, 32, 59, 86, 113 (mod 135).
Therefore, 17 ^ y = 88, 128, 63, 67, 196 (mod 271).
So 3 ^ x = 80, 120, 55, 59, 188 (mod 271), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 5.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (2, 1).

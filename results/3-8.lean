For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 8 = 5 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 271)   3 ^ x + 8 = 17 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 8 = 17 ^ y,
if x >= 5, 17 ^ y = 8 (mod 243).
So y = 5 (mod 54), 
which implies y = 5, 32, 59, 86, 113 (mod 135).
Therefore, 17 ^ y = 88, 128, 63, 67, 196 (mod 271).
So 3 ^ x = 80, 120, 55, 59, 188 (mod 271), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 5.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (2, 1).

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 8 = 383 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 383 ^ y = 8 (mod 27).
So y = 15 (mod 18),

Therefore, 383 ^ y = 31, 258, 224, 247, 80, 185, 106, 8, 154, 119, 55, 178, 39, 141, 72 (mod 271).

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 61)   3 ^ x + 8 = 395 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 8 = 395 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 3 ^ x = 17 (mod 25).
So x = 19 (mod 20), 
which implies x = 9 (mod 10).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 41 (mod 61).
So 395 ^ y = 49 (mod 61), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 8 = 395 ^ y is impossible.

(Class I, Type iii)   3 ^ x + 8 = 495 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 8 = 495 ^ y,

8 = 0 (mod 9), which is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2 or y < 2.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 8 = 495 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 8 = 497 ^ y,

So 3 ^ x = 0 (mod 19), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.

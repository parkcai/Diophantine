(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 61)   5 ^ x + 4 = 3 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 4 = 3 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 3 ^ y = 4 (mod 25).
So y = 6 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 6 (mod 10).
Therefore, 3 ^ y = 58 (mod 61).
So 5 ^ x = 54 (mod 61), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (1, 2).

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 101)   5 ^ x + 4 = 17 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 4 = 17 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 17 ^ y = 4 (mod 25).
So y = 14 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 4 (mod 10).
Therefore, 17 ^ y = 95 (mod 101).
So 5 ^ x = 91 (mod 101), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 4 = 17 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 41)   5 ^ x + 4 = 87 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 4 = 87 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 87 ^ y = 4 (mod 25).
So y = 18 (mod 20), 
Therefore, 87 ^ y = 23 (mod 41).
So 5 ^ x = 19 (mod 41), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 4 = 87 ^ y is impossible.

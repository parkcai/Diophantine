(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 61)   5 ^ x + 4 = 3 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 4 = 3 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 3 ^ y = 4 (mod 25).
So y = 6 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 6 (mod 10).
Therefore, 3 ^ y = 58 (mod 61).
So 5 ^ x = 54 (mod 61), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (1, 2).

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 101)   5 ^ x + 4 = 17 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 4 = 17 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 17 ^ y = 4 (mod 25).
So y = 14 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 4 (mod 10).
Therefore, 17 ^ y = 95 (mod 101).
So 5 ^ x = 91 (mod 101), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 4 = 17 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 41)   5 ^ x + 4 = 87 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 4 = 87 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 87 ^ y = 4 (mod 25).
So y = 18 (mod 20), 
Therefore, 87 ^ y = 23 (mod 41).
So 5 ^ x = 19 (mod 41), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 4 = 87 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 4 = 129 ^ y,

So x = 13 (mod 18),

Therefore, 5 ^ x = 5, 20, 80, 66, 10, 40, 33 (mod 127).
So 129 ^ y = 9, 24, 84, 70, 14, 44, 37 (mod 127), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 3.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 4 = 183 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 183 ^ y = 4 (mod 25).
So y = 14 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 4, 9, 14 (mod 15).
Therefore, 183 ^ y = 100, 87, 54 (mod 241).
So 5 ^ x = 96, 83, 50 (mod 241), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 4 = 183 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 181)   5 ^ x + 4 = 223 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 4 = 223 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 223 ^ y = 4 (mod 25).
So y = 2 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 2 (mod 5).
Therefore, 223 ^ y = 135 (mod 181).
So 5 ^ x = 131 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 4 = 223 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   5 ^ x + 4 = 249 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 4 = 249 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 249 ^ y = 4 (mod 25).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 4 = 249 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 281)   8 ^ x + 5 = 29 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 5 = 29 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 8 ^ x = 24 (mod 29).
So x = 12 (mod 28), 
which implies x = 12, 26, 40, 54, 68 (mod 70).
Therefore, 8 ^ x = 279, 256, 109, 98, 101 (mod 281).
So 29 ^ y = 3, 261, 114, 103, 106 (mod 281), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 8 ^ x + 5 = 29 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 5 = 111 ^ y,

(Class I, Type i)   8 ^ x + 5 = 125 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 5 = 125 ^ y,
this is impossible, because it implies that 8 ^ x = 0 (mod 5).

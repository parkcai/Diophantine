For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 5 = 3 ^ y,

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 5 = 223 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 223 ^ y = 5 (mod 8).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 8 ^ x + 5 = 223 ^ y is impossible.

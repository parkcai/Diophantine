(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 109)   5 ^ x + 2 = 3 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 2 = 3 ^ y,
if y >= 4, 5 ^ x = 79 (mod 81).
So x = 20 (mod 54), 
which implies x = 20 (mod 27).
Therefore, 5 ^ x = 35 (mod 109).
So 3 ^ y = 37 (mod 109), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 4.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (2, 3).

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 181)   5 ^ x + 2 = 123 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 2 = 123 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 123 ^ y = 2 (mod 25).
So y = 11 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 11, 31, 51, 71, 91, 111, 131, 151, 171 (mod 180).
Therefore, 123 ^ y = 90, 54, 141, 157, 58, 71, 115, 69, 150 (mod 181).
So 5 ^ x = 88, 52, 139, 155, 56, 69, 113, 67, 148 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 2 = 123 ^ y is impossible.

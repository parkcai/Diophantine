(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 109)   5 ^ x + 2 = 3 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 2 = 3 ^ y,
if y >= 4, 5 ^ x = 79 (mod 81).
So x = 20 (mod 54), 
which implies x = 20 (mod 27).
Therefore, 5 ^ x = 35 (mod 109).
So 3 ^ y = 37 (mod 109), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 4.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (2, 3).

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 181)   5 ^ x + 2 = 133 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 2 = 133 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 133 ^ y = 2 (mod 25).
So y = 7 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 1, 3, 5 (mod 6).
Therefore, 133 ^ y = 133, 180, 49 (mod 181).
So 5 ^ x = 131, 178, 47 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 2 = 133 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 61)   5 ^ x + 2 = 147 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 2 = 147 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 147 ^ y = 2 (mod 25).
So y = 13 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 3, 8, 13 (mod 15).
Therefore, 147 ^ y = 9, 56, 57 (mod 61).
So 5 ^ x = 7, 54, 55 (mod 61), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 2 = 147 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 41)   5 ^ x + 2 = 317 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 2 = 317 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 317 ^ y = 2 (mod 25).
So y = 17 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 17, 37 (mod 40).
Therefore, 317 ^ y = 13, 28 (mod 41).
So 5 ^ x = 11, 26 (mod 41), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 2 = 317 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 2 = 373 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 373 ^ y = 2 (mod 25).
So y = 11 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81 (mod 90).
Therefore, 373 ^ y = 11, 79, 156, 166, 172, 67, 4, 111, 139 (mod 181).
So 5 ^ x = 9, 77, 154, 164, 170, 65, 2, 109, 137 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.

(Class I, Type i)   5 ^ x + 2 = 500 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 2 = 500 ^ y,
this is impossible, because it implies that 5 ^ x = 0 (mod 2).

For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 7 = 3 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   8 ^ x + 7 = 243 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 7 = 243 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 243 ^ y = 7 (mod 8).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 8 ^ x + 7 = 243 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 7 = 247 ^ y,

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 8 ^ x + 7 = 247 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 37)   3 ^ x + 10 = 17 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 10 = 17 ^ y,
if x >= 4, 17 ^ y = 10 (mod 81).
So y = 4 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 4, 22 (mod 36).
Therefore, 17 ^ y = 12, 25 (mod 37).
So 3 ^ x = 2, 15 (mod 37), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 4.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 10 = 17 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 109)   3 ^ x + 10 = 29 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 10 = 29 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 29 ^ y = 10 (mod 27).
So y = 6 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 6, 24, 42 (mod 54).
Therefore, 29 ^ y = 75, 105, 38 (mod 109).
So 3 ^ x = 65, 95, 28 (mod 109), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 10 = 29 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 433)   3 ^ x + 10 = 43 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 10 = 43 ^ y,
if x >= 4, 43 ^ y = 10 (mod 81).
So y = 6 (mod 27), 
which implies y = 6, 15, 24, 33, 42, 51, 60, 69, 78, 87, 96, 105, 114, 123, 132, 141 (mod 144).
Therefore, 43 ^ y = 379, 356, 235, 295, 140, 360, 369, 21, 54, 77, 198, 138, 293, 73, 64, 412 (mod 433).
So 3 ^ x = 369, 346, 225, 285, 130, 350, 359, 11, 44, 67, 188, 128, 283, 63, 54, 402 (mod 433), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 4.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 10 = 43 ^ y is impossible.

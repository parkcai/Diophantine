(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 19)   6 ^ x + 7 = 167 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 6 ^ x + 7 = 167 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 167 ^ y = 7 (mod 27).
So y = 14 (mod 18), 
Therefore, 167 ^ y = 17 (mod 19).
So 6 ^ x = 10 (mod 19), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 6 ^ x + 7 = 167 ^ y is impossible.

(Class I, Type iii)   6 ^ x + 7 = 249 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 6 ^ x + 7 = 249 ^ y,
if x >= 2 and y >= 2,
7 = 0 (mod 9), which is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2 or y < 2.
Further examination shows that 6 ^ x + 7 = 249 ^ y is impossible.

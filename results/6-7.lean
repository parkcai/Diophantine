For positive integers x, y satisfying 6 ^ x + 7 = 5 ^ y,

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 6 ^ x + 7 = 227 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 227 ^ y = 7 (mod 8).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 6 ^ x + 7 = 227 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 17)   3 ^ x + 5 = 2 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 5 = 2 ^ y,
if y >= 6, 3 ^ x = 59 (mod 64).
So x = 11 (mod 16).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 7 (mod 17).
So 2 ^ y = 12 (mod 17), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 6.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (1, 3), (3, 5).

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 67)   3 ^ x + 5 = 92 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 5 = 92 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 3 ^ x = 18 (mod 23).
So x = 9 (mod 11), 
which implies x = 9, 20 (mod 22).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 52, 15 (mod 67).
So 92 ^ y = 57, 20 (mod 67), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 3 ^ x + 5 = 92 ^ y is impossible.

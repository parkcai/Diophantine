For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 2 = 3 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 3 ^ y = 2 (mod 49).
So y = 26 (mod 42), 
Therefore, 3 ^ y = 15 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 13 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 2 = 59 ^ y,

which implies x = 3, 25, 47, 69, 91 (mod 110).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 12, 164, 145, 106, 235 (mod 331).
So 115 ^ y = 14, 166, 147, 108, 237 (mod 331), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 2 = 115 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 757)   7 ^ x + 2 = 249 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 2 = 249 ^ y,
if y >= 4, 7 ^ x = 79 (mod 81).
So x = 22 (mod 27), 
which implies x = 22, 49, 76, 103, 130, 157, 184 (mod 189).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 567, 228, 332, 510, 145, 583, 663 (mod 757).
So 249 ^ y = 569, 230, 334, 512, 147, 585, 665 (mod 757), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 4.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 2 = 249 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 2 = 3 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 3 ^ y = 2 (mod 49).
So y = 26 (mod 42), 
Therefore, 3 ^ y = 15 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 13 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 2 = 59 ^ y,

which implies x = 3, 25, 47, 69, 91 (mod 110).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 12, 164, 145, 106, 235 (mod 331).
So 115 ^ y = 14, 166, 147, 108, 237 (mod 331), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 2 = 115 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 757)   7 ^ x + 2 = 249 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 2 = 249 ^ y,
if y >= 4, 7 ^ x = 79 (mod 81).
So x = 22 (mod 27), 
which implies x = 22, 49, 76, 103, 130, 157, 184 (mod 189).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 567, 228, 332, 510, 145, 583, 663 (mod 757).
So 249 ^ y = 569, 230, 334, 512, 147, 585, 665 (mod 757), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 4.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 2 = 249 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 257)   7 ^ x + 2 = 289 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 2 = 289 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 15 (mod 17).
So x = 2 (mod 16), 
which implies x = 2, 18, 34, 50, 66, 82, 98, 114, 130, 146, 162, 178, 194, 210, 226, 242 (mod 256).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 49, 104, 205, 26, 244, 135, 61, 98, 208, 153, 52, 231, 13, 122, 196, 159 (mod 257).
So 289 ^ y = 51, 106, 207, 28, 246, 137, 63, 100, 210, 155, 54, 233, 15, 124, 198, 161 (mod 257), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 2 = 289 ^ y is impossible.

So y = 22 (mod 294), 
Therefore, 439 ^ y = 443 (mod 883).
So 7 ^ x = 441 (mod 883), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 2 = 439 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 43)   7 ^ x + 2 = 453 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 2 = 453 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 453 ^ y = 2 (mod 49).
So y = 10 (mod 42), 
which implies y = 10 (mod 21).
Therefore, 453 ^ y = 31 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 29 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 2 = 453 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 2 = 495 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 9 (mod 11).
So x = 8 (mod 10), 
which implies x = 3, 8, 13 (mod 15).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 2, 10, 19 (mod 31).
So 495 ^ y = 4, 12, 21 (mod 31), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 2 = 495 ^ y is impossible.

(Class I, Type iii)   10 ^ x + 9 = 98 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 9 = 98 ^ y,
if x >= 4 and y >= 4,
9 = 0 (mod 16), which is impossible.
Therefore, x < 4 or y < 4.
Further examination shows that 10 ^ x + 9 = 98 ^ y is impossible.

(Class I, Type i)   10 ^ x + 9 = 99 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 9 = 99 ^ y,
this is impossible, because it implies that 10 ^ x = 0 (mod 9).

(Class I, Type iii)   10 ^ x + 9 = 100 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 9 = 100 ^ y,
if x >= 1 and y >= 1,
9 = 0 (mod 10), which is impossible.
Therefore, x < 1 or y < 1.
So 10 ^ x + 9 = 100 ^ y is impossible.

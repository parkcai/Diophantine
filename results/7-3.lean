For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 3 = 2 ^ y,

Therefore, x < 1.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 43)   7 ^ x + 3 = 17 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 3 = 17 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 17 ^ y = 3 (mod 49).
So y = 37 (mod 42), 
which implies y = 16 (mod 21).
Therefore, 17 ^ y = 14 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 11 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 3 = 17 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 181)   7 ^ x + 3 = 31 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 3 = 31 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 28 (mod 31).
So x = 7 (mod 15), 
which implies x = 1, 4, 7, 10 (mod 12).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 7, 48, 174, 133 (mod 181).
So 31 ^ y = 10, 51, 177, 136 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 3 = 31 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 43)   7 ^ x + 3 = 73 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 3 = 73 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 73 ^ y = 3 (mod 49).
So y = 25 (mod 42), 
Therefore, 73 ^ y = 34 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 31 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 3 = 73 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 3 = 101 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 101 ^ y = 3 (mod 49).
So y = 1 (mod 42), 
which implies y = 1 (mod 21).
Therefore, 101 ^ y = 15 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 12 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 3 = 101 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 3 = 143 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 8 (mod 11).
So x = 9 (mod 10), 
which implies x = 4, 9, 14 (mod 15).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 14, 8, 9 (mod 31).
So 143 ^ y = 17, 11, 12 (mod 31), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 3 = 143 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   7 ^ x + 3 = 499 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 3 = 499 ^ y,
if x >= 1, 499 ^ y = 3 (mod 7).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 3 = 499 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, no magic prime)   7 ^ x + 3 = 500 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 3 = 500 ^ y,
if y >= 3, 7 ^ x = 5 (mod 8).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 3.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 3 = 500 ^ y is impossible.

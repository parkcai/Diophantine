For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 2 = 113 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 113 ^ y = 2 (mod 27).
So y = 11 (mod 18),

Therefore, 113 ^ y = 13, 24 (mod 37).
So 9 ^ x = 11, 22 (mod 37), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 2 = 113 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 2 = 359 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   9 ^ x + 2 = 499 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 2 = 499 ^ y,
if x >= 1, 499 ^ y = 2 (mod 3).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 1.
So 9 ^ x + 2 = 499 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 73)   3 ^ x + 7 = 2 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 2 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 2 ^ y = 7 (mod 27).
So y = 16 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 7 (mod 9).
Therefore, 2 ^ y = 55 (mod 73).
So 3 ^ x = 48 (mod 73), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (2, 4).

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 34 ^ y,
if y >= 6, 3 ^ x = 57 (mod 64).
So x = 14 (mod 16),

Therefore, y < 6.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 160 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 3 ^ x = 18 (mod 25).
So x = 5 (mod 20), 
which implies x = 5 (mod 10).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 60 (mod 61).
So 160 ^ y = 6 (mod 61), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 7 = 160 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 67)   3 ^ x + 7 = 230 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 230 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 3 ^ x = 16 (mod 23).
So x = 6 (mod 11), 
which implies x = 6, 17 (mod 22).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 59, 8 (mod 67).
So 230 ^ y = 66, 15 (mod 67), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.

Therefore, 241 ^ y = 385, 365, 48, 68 (mod 433).

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 769)   3 ^ x + 7 = 250 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 250 ^ y,
if y >= 6, 3 ^ x = 57 (mod 64).
So x = 14 (mod 16), 
which implies x = 14, 30, 46 (mod 48).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 558, 40, 171 (mod 769).
So 250 ^ y = 565, 47, 178 (mod 769), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 6.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (5, 1).

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 310 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 3 ^ x = 18 (mod 25).
So x = 5 (mod 20), 
which implies x = 5 (mod 10).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 60 (mod 61).
So 310 ^ y = 6 (mod 61), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 7 = 310 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 61)   3 ^ x + 7 = 320 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 320 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 3 ^ x = 18 (mod 25).
So x = 5 (mod 20), 
which implies x = 5 (mod 10).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 60 (mod 61).
So 320 ^ y = 6 (mod 61), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 7 = 320 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 331 ^ y,
if x >= 4, 331 ^ y = 7 (mod 81).
So y = 1 (mod 27), 
which implies y = 1, 10 (mod 18).
Therefore, 331 ^ y = 4, 105 (mod 109).
So 3 ^ x = 106, 98 (mod 109), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 4.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 7 = 331 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 449)   3 ^ x + 7 = 382 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 382 ^ y,
if y >= 6, 3 ^ x = 57 (mod 64).
So x = 14 (mod 16), 
which implies x = 14, 30, 46, 62, 78, 94, 110, 126, 142, 158, 174, 190, 206, 222, 238, 254, 270, 286, 302, 318, 334, 350, 366, 382, 398, 414, 430, 446 (mod 448).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 221, 447, 63, 36, 213, 250, 207, 439, 315, 180, 167, 352, 137, 399, 228, 2, 386, 413, 236, 199, 242, 10, 134, 269, 282, 97, 312, 50 (mod 449).
So 382 ^ y = 228, 5, 70, 43, 220, 257, 214, 446, 322, 187, 174, 359, 144, 406, 235, 9, 393, 420, 243, 206, 249, 17, 141, 276, 289, 104, 319, 57 (mod 449), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 6.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 7 = 382 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 641)   3 ^ x + 7 = 391 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 391 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 3 ^ x = 10 (mod 17).
So x = 3 (mod 16), 
which implies x = 3, 19, 35, 51, 67, 83, 99, 115, 131, 147, 163, 179, 195, 211, 227, 243, 259, 275, 291, 307, 323, 339, 355, 371, 387, 403, 419, 435, 451, 467, 483, 499, 515, 531, 547, 563, 579, 595, 611, 627 (mod 640).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 27, 267, 290, 375, 76, 253, 294, 557, 24, 451, 329, 547, 210, 581, 475, 139, 235, 116, 150, 415, 614, 374, 351, 266, 565, 388, 347, 84, 617, 190, 312, 94, 431, 60, 166, 502, 406, 525, 491, 226 (mod 641).
So 391 ^ y = 34, 274, 297, 382, 83, 260, 301, 564, 31, 458, 336, 554, 217, 588, 482, 146, 242, 123, 157, 422, 621, 381, 358, 273, 572, 395, 354, 91, 624, 197, 319, 101, 438, 67, 173, 509, 413, 532, 498, 233 (mod 641), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 3 ^ x + 7 = 391 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 433)   3 ^ x + 7 = 394 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 394 ^ y,
if x >= 4, 394 ^ y = 7 (mod 81).
So y = 22 (mod 27), 
which implies y = 22, 49, 76, 103, 130, 157, 184, 211 (mod 216).
Therefore, 394 ^ y = 204, 95, 144, 118, 229, 338, 289, 315 (mod 433).
So 3 ^ x = 197, 88, 137, 111, 222, 331, 282, 308 (mod 433), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 4.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 400 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 3 ^ x = 18 (mod 25).
So x = 5 (mod 20),

Therefore, 3 ^ x = 60 (mod 61).

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 181)   3 ^ x + 7 = 410 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 410 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 3 ^ x = 18 (mod 25).
So x = 5 (mod 20), 
which implies x = 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 (mod 45).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 1, 62, 43, 132, 39, 65, 48, 80, 73 (mod 181).
So 410 ^ y = 8, 69, 50, 139, 46, 72, 55, 87, 80 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 7 = 410 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 181)   3 ^ x + 7 = 452 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 452 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 452 ^ y = 7 (mod 27).
So y = 10 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 10, 28, 46, 64, 82, 100, 118, 136, 154, 172 (mod 180).
Therefore, 452 ^ y = 108, 170, 100, 144, 106, 73, 11, 81, 37, 75 (mod 181).
So 3 ^ x = 101, 163, 93, 137, 99, 66, 4, 74, 30, 68 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 7 = 452 ^ y is impossible.

if x >= 3, 461 ^ y = 7 (mod 27).
So y = 16 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 16, 34, 52, 70, 88, 106, 124, 142, 160, 178, 196, 214, 232, 250, 268, 286, 304, 322, 340, 358, 376, 394, 412, 430 (mod 432).
Therefore, 461 ^ y = 139, 25, 397, 277, 190, 246, 200, 145, 51, 221, 236, 301, 294, 408, 36, 156, 243, 187, 233, 288, 382, 212, 197, 132 (mod 433).
So 3 ^ x = 132, 18, 390, 270, 183, 239, 193, 138, 44, 214, 229, 294, 287, 401, 29, 149, 236, 180, 226, 281, 375, 205, 190, 125 (mod 433), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 7 = 461 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 470 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 470 ^ y = 7 (mod 27).
So y = 4 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 1 (mod 3).
Therefore, 470 ^ y = 26 (mod 37).
So 3 ^ x = 19 (mod 37), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 7 = 470 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 73)   3 ^ x + 7 = 2 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 2 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 2 ^ y = 7 (mod 27).
So y = 16 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 7 (mod 9).
Therefore, 2 ^ y = 55 (mod 73).
So 3 ^ x = 48 (mod 73), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (2, 4).

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 34 ^ y,
if y >= 6, 3 ^ x = 57 (mod 64).
So x = 14 (mod 16),

Therefore, y < 6.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 99 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   3 ^ x + 7 = 100 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 7 = 100 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 100 ^ y = 7 (mod 9).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 7 = 100 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 5 = 2 ^ y,

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 5 = 2 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 73)   9 ^ x + 5 = 191 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 5 = 191 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 191 ^ y = 5 (mod 27).
So y = 5 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 5, 23, 41, 59 (mod 72).
Therefore, 191 ^ y = 39, 31, 34, 42 (mod 73).
So 9 ^ x = 34, 26, 29, 37 (mod 73), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 5 = 191 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 73)   9 ^ x + 5 = 239 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 5 = 239 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 239 ^ y = 5 (mod 27).
So y = 7 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 7, 25, 43, 61 (mod 72).
Therefore, 239 ^ y = 42, 39, 31, 34 (mod 73).
So 9 ^ x = 37, 34, 26, 29 (mod 73), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 5 = 239 ^ y is impossible.

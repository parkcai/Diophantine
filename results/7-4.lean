(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 43)   7 ^ x + 4 = 61 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 4 = 61 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 61 ^ y = 4 (mod 49).
So y = 20 (mod 42), 
Therefore, 61 ^ y = 31 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 27 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 4 = 61 ^ y is impossible.

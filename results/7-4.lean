(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 43)   7 ^ x + 4 = 61 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 4 = 61 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 61 ^ y = 4 (mod 49).
So y = 20 (mod 42), 
Therefore, 61 ^ y = 31 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 27 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 4 = 61 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 4 = 121 ^ y,

Therefore, 233 ^ y = 31, 12 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 27, 8 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 4 = 233 ^ y is impossible.

if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 13 (mod 17).
So x = 12 (mod 16), 
which implies x = 12, 28, 44, 60, 76, 92, 108, 124, 140, 156, 172, 188, 204, 220, 236, 252 (mod 256).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 165, 46, 234, 140, 187, 35, 111, 73, 92, 211, 23, 117, 70, 222, 146, 184 (mod 257).
So 289 ^ y = 169, 50, 238, 144, 191, 39, 115, 77, 96, 215, 27, 121, 74, 226, 150, 188 (mod 257), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 4 = 289 ^ y is impossible.

So y = 883 (mod 1029),

Therefore, y < 1.

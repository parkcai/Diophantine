(Class I, Type iii)   2 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y,
if x >= 1 and y >= 1,
1 = 0 (mod 2), which is impossible.
Therefore, x < 1 or y < 1.
So 2 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 1 = 3 ^ y,

For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 1 = 33 ^ y,
if y >= 3, 2 ^ x = 26 (mod 27).
So x = 9 (mod 18).
Therefore, 2 ^ x = 18 (mod 19).
So 33 ^ y = 0 (mod 19), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 3.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 17)   2 ^ x + 1 = 43 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 1 = 43 ^ y,
if x >= 6, 43 ^ y = 1 (mod 64).
So y = 0 (mod 16), 
which implies y = 0 (mod 8).
Therefore, 43 ^ y = 1 (mod 17).
So 2 ^ x = 0 (mod 17), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 6.
Further examination shows that 2 ^ x + 1 = 43 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 1 = 85 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 2 ^ x = 24 (mod 25).
So x = 10 (mod 20).
Therefore, 2 ^ x = 40 (mod 41).
So 85 ^ y = 0 (mod 41), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 1 = 97 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 2 ^ x = 96 (mod 97).
So x = 24 (mod 48),

Therefore, y < 1.

(Class I, Type iii)   8 ^ x + 3 = 2 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 3 = 2 ^ y,
if x >= 2 and y >= 2,
3 = 0 (mod 4), which is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2 or y < 2.
Further examination shows that 8 ^ x + 3 = 2 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   8 ^ x + 3 = 247 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 3 = 247 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 247 ^ y = 3 (mod 8).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 8 ^ x + 3 = 247 ^ y is impossible.

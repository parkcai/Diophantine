For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 4 = 31 ^ y,
if x >= 4, 31 ^ y = 4 (mod 81).
So y = 19 (mod 27), 
which implies y = 19, 46, 73, 100, 127, 154, 181, 208, 235, 262, 289, 316, 343, 370, 397, 424 (mod 432).
Therefore, 31 ^ y = 248, 96, 107, 223, 226, 297, 101, 81, 185, 337, 326, 210, 207, 136, 332, 352 (mod 433).
So 3 ^ x = 244, 92, 103, 219, 222, 293, 97, 77, 181, 333, 322, 206, 203, 132, 328, 348 (mod 433), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 4.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (3, 1).

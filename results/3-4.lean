For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 4 = 31 ^ y,
if x >= 4, 31 ^ y = 4 (mod 81).
So y = 19 (mod 27), 
which implies y = 19, 46, 73, 100, 127, 154, 181, 208, 235, 262, 289, 316, 343, 370, 397, 424 (mod 432).
Therefore, 31 ^ y = 248, 96, 107, 223, 226, 297, 101, 81, 185, 337, 326, 210, 207, 136, 332, 352 (mod 433).
So 3 ^ x = 244, 92, 103, 219, 222, 293, 97, 77, 181, 333, 322, 206, 203, 132, 328, 348 (mod 433), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 4.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (3, 1).

Therefore, 3 ^ x = 1, 40 (mod 41).
So 155 ^ y = 5, 3 (mod 41), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 4 = 155 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 109)   3 ^ x + 4 = 169 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 4 = 169 ^ y,
if x >= 4, 169 ^ y = 4 (mod 81).
So y = 17 (mod 27), 
which implies y = 17, 44 (mod 54).
Therefore, 169 ^ y = 61, 48 (mod 109).
So 3 ^ x = 57, 44 (mod 109), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 4.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 4 = 169 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 4 = 317 ^ y,

So y = 8 (mod 18),

Therefore, 317 ^ y = 21, 36, 15, 88, 73, 94 (mod 109).
So 3 ^ x = 17, 32, 11, 84, 69, 90 (mod 109), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 4 = 439 ^ y,
if x >= 4, 439 ^ y = 4 (mod 81).
So y = 8 (mod 27), 
Therefore, 439 ^ y = 21 (mod 109).
So 3 ^ x = 17 (mod 109), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 4.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 4 = 439 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 353)   3 ^ x + 4 = 493 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 4 = 493 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 3 ^ x = 13 (mod 17).
So x = 4 (mod 16), 
which implies x = 4, 20, 36, 52, 68, 84, 100, 116, 132, 148, 164, 180, 196, 212, 228, 244, 260, 276, 292, 308, 324, 340 (mod 352).
Therefore, 3 ^ x = 81, 73, 44, 336, 159, 91, 21, 32, 116, 244, 2, 272, 280, 309, 17, 194, 262, 332, 321, 237, 109, 351 (mod 353).
So 493 ^ y = 85, 77, 48, 340, 163, 95, 25, 36, 120, 248, 6, 276, 284, 313, 21, 198, 266, 336, 325, 241, 113, 2 (mod 353), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 3 ^ x + 4 = 493 ^ y is impossible.

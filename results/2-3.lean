For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 3 = 2 ^ y,
if x >= 2 and y >= 2,
3 = 0 (mod 4), which is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2 or y < 2.
Further examination shows that 2 ^ x + 3 = 2 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 3 = 107 ^ y,

So y = 15 (mod 16),

Therefore, x < 6.

(Class II, Front Mode, no magic prime)   2 ^ x + 3 = 115 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 3 = 115 ^ y,

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 2 ^ x + 3 = 115 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 3 = 203 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 337)   2 ^ x + 3 = 283 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 3 = 283 ^ y,
if x >= 6, 283 ^ y = 3 (mod 64).
So y = 11 (mod 16), 
which implies y = 3, 11, 19 (mod 24).
Therefore, 283 ^ y = 252, 181, 241 (mod 337).
So 2 ^ x = 249, 178, 238 (mod 337), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 6.
Further examination shows that 2 ^ x + 3 = 283 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 17)   2 ^ x + 3 = 395 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 3 = 395 ^ y,
if x >= 6, 395 ^ y = 3 (mod 64).
So y = 7 (mod 16), 
which implies y = 3 (mod 4).
Therefore, 395 ^ y = 13 (mod 17).
So 2 ^ x = 10 (mod 17), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 6.
Further examination shows that 2 ^ x + 3 = 395 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 71)   2 ^ x + 3 = 451 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 2 ^ x + 3 = 451 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 2 ^ x = 8 (mod 11).
So x = 3 (mod 10), 
which implies x = 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, 33 (mod 35).
Therefore, 2 ^ x = 8, 43, 27, 12, 29, 5, 18 (mod 71).
So 451 ^ y = 11, 46, 30, 15, 32, 8, 21 (mod 71), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 2 ^ x + 3 = 451 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 37)   9 ^ x + 7 = 2 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 7 = 2 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 2 ^ y = 7 (mod 27).
So y = 16 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 16, 34 (mod 36).
Therefore, 2 ^ y = 9, 28 (mod 37).
So 9 ^ x = 2, 21 (mod 37), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (1, 4).

So y = 4 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 4, 22, 40, 58, 76 (mod 90).
Therefore, 173 ^ y = 69, 148, 125, 166, 34 (mod 271).
So 9 ^ x = 62, 141, 118, 159, 27 (mod 271), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 7 = 173 ^ y is impossible.

So x = 3 (mod 11), 
which implies x = 3, 14, 25, 36, 47, 58, 69, 80, 91 (mod 99).
Therefore, 9 ^ x = 332, 26, 69, 290, 281, 364, 172, 90, 361 (mod 397).
So 184 ^ y = 339, 33, 76, 297, 288, 371, 179, 97, 368 (mod 397), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 9 ^ x + 7 = 184 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 37)   9 ^ x + 7 = 218 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 7 = 218 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 218 ^ y = 7 (mod 27).
So y = 16 (mod 18), 
which implies y = 7 (mod 9).
Therefore, 218 ^ y = 7 (mod 37).
So 9 ^ x = 0 (mod 37), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 7 = 218 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 541)   9 ^ x + 7 = 229 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 7 = 229 ^ y,
if x >= 4, 229 ^ y = 7 (mod 81).
So y = 20 (mod 27), 
which implies y = 2, 11 (mod 18).
Therefore, 229 ^ y = 505, 36 (mod 541).
So 9 ^ x = 498, 29 (mod 541), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 4.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 7 = 229 ^ y is impossible.

Therefore, 241 ^ y = 241, 252, 268, 242, 81 (mod 271).

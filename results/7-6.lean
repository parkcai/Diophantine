(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 43)   7 ^ x + 6 = 199 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 6 = 199 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 199 ^ y = 6 (mod 49).
So y = 27 (mod 42), 
which implies y = 13 (mod 14).
Therefore, 199 ^ y = 8 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 2 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 6 = 199 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 43)   7 ^ x + 6 = 409 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 6 = 409 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 409 ^ y = 6 (mod 49).
So y = 33 (mod 42), 
which implies y = 5 (mod 14).
Therefore, 409 ^ y = 39 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 33 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 6 = 409 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 449)   7 ^ x + 6 = 425 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 6 = 425 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 7 ^ x = 11 (mod 17).
So x = 5 (mod 16), 
which implies x = 5, 21, 37, 53, 69, 85, 101 (mod 112).
Therefore, 7 ^ x = 194, 349, 445, 377, 51, 20, 360 (mod 449).
So 425 ^ y = 200, 355, 2, 383, 57, 26, 366 (mod 449), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 7 ^ x + 6 = 425 ^ y is impossible.

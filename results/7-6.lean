(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 43)   7 ^ x + 6 = 199 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 7 ^ x + 6 = 199 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 199 ^ y = 6 (mod 49).
So y = 27 (mod 42), 
which implies y = 13 (mod 14).
Therefore, 199 ^ y = 8 (mod 43).
So 7 ^ x = 2 (mod 43), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 7 ^ x + 6 = 199 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 4 ^ x + 5 = 3 ^ y,

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 757)   4 ^ x + 5 = 69 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 4 ^ x + 5 = 69 ^ y,
if y >= 4, 4 ^ x = 76 (mod 81).
So x = 25 (mod 27),

Therefore, 4 ^ x = 623, 393, 706, 336, 280, 738, 615, 134, 364, 51, 421, 477, 19, 142 (mod 757).

Therefore, y < 4.

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   4 ^ x + 5 = 249 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 4 ^ x + 5 = 249 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 249 ^ y = 5 (mod 8).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 4 ^ x + 5 = 249 ^ y is impossible.

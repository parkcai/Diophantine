For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 7 = 2 ^ y,

Therefore, x < 3 or y < 3.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 7 = 29 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   10 ^ x + 7 = 43 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 7 = 43 ^ y,

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 10 ^ x + 7 = 43 ^ y is impossible.

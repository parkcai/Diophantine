For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 7 = 2 ^ y,

Therefore, x < 3 or y < 3.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 7 = 29 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   10 ^ x + 7 = 43 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 7 = 43 ^ y,

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 10 ^ x + 7 = 43 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 101)   10 ^ x + 7 = 167 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 7 = 167 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 167 ^ y = 7 (mod 25).
So y = 5 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 5, 25, 45, 65, 85 (mod 100).
Therefore, 167 ^ y = 44, 91, 39, 60, 69 (mod 101).
So 10 ^ x = 37, 84, 32, 53, 62 (mod 101), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 10 ^ x + 7 = 167 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 7 = 221 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 101)   10 ^ x + 7 = 263 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 7 = 263 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 263 ^ y = 7 (mod 25).
So y = 15 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 15, 35, 55, 75, 95 (mod 100).
Therefore, 263 ^ y = 69, 60, 39, 91, 44 (mod 101).
So 10 ^ x = 62, 53, 32, 84, 37 (mod 101), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 10 ^ x + 7 = 263 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 7 = 495 ^ y,

Therefore, x < 2 or y < 2.

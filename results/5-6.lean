(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 181)   5 ^ x + 6 = 97 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 6 = 97 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 97 ^ y = 6 (mod 25).
So y = 4 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 4, 24, 44, 64, 84, 104, 124, 144, 164 (mod 180).
Therefore, 97 ^ y = 9, 25, 170, 70, 114, 15, 102, 42, 177 (mod 181).
So 5 ^ x = 3, 19, 164, 64, 108, 9, 96, 36, 171 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 6 = 97 ^ y is impossible.

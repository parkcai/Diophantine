For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 6 = 187 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 5 ^ x = 11 (mod 17).
So x = 11 (mod 16),

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 181)   5 ^ x + 6 = 197 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 6 = 197 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 197 ^ y = 6 (mod 25).
So y = 4 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 39, 44 (mod 45).
Therefore, 197 ^ y = 14, 59, 3, 129, 117, 144, 38, 5, 34 (mod 181).
So 5 ^ x = 8, 53, 178, 123, 111, 138, 32, 180, 28 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 6 = 197 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 101)   5 ^ x + 6 = 211 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 6 = 211 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 211 ^ y = 6 (mod 125).
So y = 23 (mod 25), 
which implies y = 23, 48 (mod 50).
Therefore, 211 ^ y = 96, 5 (mod 101).
So 5 ^ x = 90, 100 (mod 101), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 6 = 211 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 6 = 241 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 241 ^ y = 6 (mod 125).
So y = 22 (mod 25), 
Therefore, 241 ^ y = 63 (mod 251).
So 5 ^ x = 57 (mod 251), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.

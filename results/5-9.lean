For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 9 = 2 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 41)   5 ^ x + 9 = 17 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 9 = 17 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 17 ^ y = 9 (mod 25).
So y = 18 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 18, 38 (mod 40).
Therefore, 17 ^ y = 20, 21 (mod 41).
So 5 ^ x = 11, 12 (mod 41), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 9 = 17 ^ y is impossible.

So y = 2 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 2, 22 (mod 40).
Therefore, 97 ^ y = 20, 21 (mod 41).

Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 9 = 97 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 101)   5 ^ x + 9 = 137 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 9 = 137 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 137 ^ y = 9 (mod 25).
So y = 6 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 1 (mod 5).
Therefore, 137 ^ y = 36 (mod 101).
So 5 ^ x = 27 (mod 101), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 9 = 137 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 9 = 245 ^ y,

Therefore, x < 2 or y < 2.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 9 = 2 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 41)   5 ^ x + 9 = 17 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 9 = 17 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 17 ^ y = 9 (mod 25).
So y = 18 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 18, 38 (mod 40).
Therefore, 17 ^ y = 20, 21 (mod 41).
So 5 ^ x = 11, 12 (mod 41), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 9 = 17 ^ y is impossible.

So y = 2 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 2, 22 (mod 40).
Therefore, 97 ^ y = 20, 21 (mod 41).

Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 9 = 97 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, no magic prime)   5 ^ x + 9 = 124 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 9 = 124 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 5 ^ x = 3 (mod 4).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 9 = 124 ^ y is impossible.

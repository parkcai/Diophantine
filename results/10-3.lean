(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   10 ^ x + 3 = 7 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 3 = 7 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 7 ^ y = 3 (mod 8).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 10 ^ x + 3 = 7 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   10 ^ x + 3 = 241 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 3 = 241 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 241 ^ y = 3 (mod 4).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 10 ^ x + 3 = 241 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   10 ^ x + 3 = 247 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 10 ^ x + 3 = 247 ^ y,

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 10 ^ x + 3 = 247 ^ y is impossible.

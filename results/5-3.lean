(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 257)   5 ^ x + 3 = 2 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 3 = 2 ^ y,
if y >= 8, 5 ^ x = 253 (mod 256).
So x = 35 (mod 64), 
which implies x = 35, 99, 163, 227 (mod 256).
Therefore, 5 ^ x = 14, 224, 243, 33 (mod 257).
So 2 ^ y = 17, 227, 246, 36 (mod 257), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 8.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (1, 3), (3, 7).

So x = 3 (mod 16), 
which implies x = 3, 19, 35, 51, 67, 83 (mod 96).
Therefore, 5 ^ x = 28, 38, 10, 69, 59, 87 (mod 97).
So 28 ^ y = 31, 41, 13, 72, 62, 90 (mod 97), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 6.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (2, 1).

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 181)   5 ^ x + 3 = 67 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 3 = 67 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 67 ^ y = 3 (mod 25).
So y = 19 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 9, 19, 29 (mod 30).
Therefore, 67 ^ y = 56, 152, 154 (mod 181).
So 5 ^ x = 53, 149, 151 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 3 = 67 ^ y is impossible.

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 3 = 218 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 5 ^ x + 3 = 248 ^ y,
if x >= 2, 248 ^ y = 3 (mod 25).
So y = 17 (mod 20), 
which implies y = 7, 17, 27 (mod 30).
Therefore, 248 ^ y = 99, 36, 46 (mod 181).
So 5 ^ x = 96, 33, 43 (mod 181), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2.
Further examination shows that 5 ^ x + 3 = 248 ^ y is impossible.

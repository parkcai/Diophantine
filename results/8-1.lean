(Class I, Type iii)   8 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y,
if x >= 1 and y >= 1,
1 = 0 (mod 2), which is impossible.
Therefore, x < 1 or y < 1.
So 8 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 17)   8 ^ x + 1 = 3 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 1 = 3 ^ y,
if x >= 6, 3 ^ y = 1 (mod 64).
So y = 0 (mod 16), 
Therefore, 3 ^ y = 1 (mod 17).
So 8 ^ x = 0 (mod 17), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 6.
Further examination shows that (x, y) = (1, 2).

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 61)   8 ^ x + 1 = 33 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 1 = 33 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 8 ^ x = 10 (mod 11).
So x = 5 (mod 10), 
which implies x = 5, 15 (mod 20).
Therefore, 8 ^ x = 11, 50 (mod 61).
So 33 ^ y = 12, 51 (mod 61), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 8 ^ x + 1 = 33 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 17)   8 ^ x + 1 = 43 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 1 = 43 ^ y,
if x >= 6, 43 ^ y = 1 (mod 64).
So y = 0 (mod 16), 
which implies y = 0 (mod 8).
Therefore, 43 ^ y = 1 (mod 17).
So 8 ^ x = 0 (mod 17), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 6.
Further examination shows that 8 ^ x + 1 = 43 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 41)   8 ^ x + 1 = 85 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 1 = 85 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 8 ^ x = 24 (mod 25).
So x = 10 (mod 20).
Therefore, 8 ^ x = 40 (mod 41).
So 85 ^ y = 0 (mod 41), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 8 ^ x + 1 = 85 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 113)   8 ^ x + 1 = 97 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 8 ^ x + 1 = 97 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 8 ^ x = 96 (mod 97).
So x = 8 (mod 16), 
which implies x = 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24 (mod 28).
Therefore, 8 ^ x = 1, 28, 106, 30, 49, 16, 109 (mod 113).
So 97 ^ y = 2, 29, 107, 31, 50, 17, 110 (mod 113), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 8 ^ x + 1 = 97 ^ y is impossible.

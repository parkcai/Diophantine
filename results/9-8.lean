(Class II, Back Mode, no magic prime)   9 ^ x + 8 = 247 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 8 = 247 ^ y,
if x >= 1, 247 ^ y = 2 (mod 3).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 1.
So 9 ^ x + 8 = 247 ^ y is impossible.

(Class I, Type iii)   9 ^ x + 8 = 249 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 8 = 249 ^ y,
if x >= 2 and y >= 2,
8 = 0 (mod 9), which is impossible.
Therefore, x < 2 or y < 2.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 8 = 249 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 6 ^ x + 5 = 131 ^ y,

(Class II, Back Mode, with magic prime 37)   6 ^ x + 5 = 173 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 6 ^ x + 5 = 173 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 173 ^ y = 5 (mod 27).
So y = 17 (mod 18), 
Therefore, 173 ^ y = 3 (mod 37).
So 6 ^ x = 35 (mod 37), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 6 ^ x + 5 = 173 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 6 ^ x + 5 = 244 ^ y,

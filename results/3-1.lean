For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 1 = 25 ^ y,

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 1 = 101 ^ y,

(Class I, Type iii)   3 ^ x + 1 = 123 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 1 = 123 ^ y,

1 = 0 (mod 3), which is impossible.
Therefore, x < 1 or y < 1.
So 3 ^ x + 1 = 123 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, no magic prime)   3 ^ x + 1 = 124 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 1 = 124 ^ y,

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 3.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 1 = 124 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 3 ^ x + 1 = 125 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 3 ^ x = 24 (mod 25).
So x = 10 (mod 20),

Therefore, 3 ^ x = 1 (mod 61).
So 125 ^ y = 2 (mod 61), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 3 ^ x + 1 = 125 ^ y is impossible.

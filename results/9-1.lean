For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y,

However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, with magic prime 41)   9 ^ x + 1 = 85 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 1 = 85 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 9 ^ x = 24 (mod 25).
So x = 5 (mod 10), 
which implies x = 1, 3 (mod 4).
Therefore, 9 ^ x = 9, 32 (mod 41).
So 85 ^ y = 10, 33 (mod 41), but this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 1 = 85 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 1 = 211 ^ y,

So y = 0 (mod 27),

Therefore, 211 ^ y = 1, 108 (mod 109).

Therefore, x < 4.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 1 = 233 ^ y,

Therefore, x < 4.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 1 = 277 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, no magic prime)   9 ^ x + 1 = 500 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 1 = 500 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 9 ^ x = 3 (mod 4).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 1 = 500 ^ y is impossible.

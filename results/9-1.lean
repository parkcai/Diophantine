(Class II, Front Mode, no magic prime)   9 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 9 ^ x = 3 (mod 4).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 1 = 2 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, no magic prime)   9 ^ x + 1 = 250 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 9 ^ x + 1 = 250 ^ y,
if y >= 2, 9 ^ x = 3 (mod 4).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 2.
Further examination shows that 9 ^ x + 1 = 250 ^ y is impossible.

For positive integers x, y satisfying 6 ^ x + 1 = 59 ^ y,
if x >= 3, 59 ^ y = 1 (mod 27).
So y = 0 (mod 18), 
Therefore, 59 ^ y = 1 (mod 19).
So 6 ^ x = 0 (mod 19), but this is impossible.
Therefore, x < 3.
Further examination shows that 6 ^ x + 1 = 59 ^ y is impossible.

(Class II, Front Mode, no magic prime)   6 ^ x + 1 = 125 ^ y
For positive integers x, y satisfying 6 ^ x + 1 = 125 ^ y,
if y >= 1, 6 ^ x = 4 (mod 5).
However, this is impossible.
Therefore, y < 1.
So 6 ^ x + 1 = 125 ^ y is impossible.
